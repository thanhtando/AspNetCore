GitHub has made changes in password authentication. 
If you are trying to access git by username and password then it does not allow you. 
So use a personal access token instead of a password to access git every where.
Here are the steps to generate Personal access tokens.

Click here - https://github.com/settings/tokens
Step 1 - Open GitHub and log in with your credentials.
Step 2 - Click on the Setting menu.
Step 3 - From the Setting menu click on Developer Settings
Step 4 - From the Developer Settings, menu click on Personal access token
Step 5 - From the Personal access token click on the Generate new Token button.
Step 6 - Now fill up required details like Note, Expiration, Select scopes. And then click on Generate Token button.
Step 7 - After that new token has been generated. Copy that generated token and use this token to access Git with username and token.

If you are using windows operating system then please follow the below step.
Open Control Panel => User Accounts => Manage your credentials => Windows Credentials.
It will show all generic credentials.
Find your GitHub URL and click on that. 
Now click on the edit button. 
And then add the personal access token generated from GitHub into the password field.
And click on the Save button.
Now you can access git.
If you are accessing Git in Android Studio, 
if asked for a password then add the GitHub personal access token instead of your password every where.


------------------
Mac users -- a simple solution.
Set up the personal access token in GitHub:
Settings → Developer Settings → Personal access token
Open Keychain → type "GitHub"
Change the password to the personal access token.
Try commit/pushing.
Select "Always allow" and business is as usual.
